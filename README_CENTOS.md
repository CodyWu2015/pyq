This is adapted from original pyq package to allow one to play with pyq + 32bit free kdb on centos 64bit system.

The main change is adding the customized makefile so it will install 32bit pyq and related shared library.

Also, nothing is installed automatically outside the downloaded source directory to keep it clean.
